Project: Beach Restoration Project
Type: Progress Update

Update Content:
Phase 1 of the beach restoration project is now 75% complete. The sand replenishment along the northern section (Stations 0+00 to 15+00) has been completed, with approximately 45,000 cubic yards of sand placed and graded to design specifications. Wave monitoring stations have been installed and are collecting data as planned.

We encountered some minor delays last week due to unexpected weather conditions, but our team adjusted work schedules to maintain overall project timeline. Water quality monitoring continues to show results within acceptable parameters.

Action Items:
- Complete environmental monitoring report for January 2025
- Schedule coordination meeting with local fishing community for Phase 2 planning
- Finalize equipment mobilization plan for southern section work

Next Steps:
- Begin sand placement at Station 15+00 (scheduled for Feb 15)
- Install remaining wave monitoring stations at southern section
- Conduct pre-construction survey of dune vegetation in Phase 2 area
