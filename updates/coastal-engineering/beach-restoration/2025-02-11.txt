Type: Progress Update

Update Content:
We’ve made solid progress on Phase 1—about 75% is now wrapped up. The team finished sand replenishment along the northern stretch (Stations 0+00 to 15+00), placing and grading roughly 45,000 cubic yards of sand to spec. The wave monitoring stations are up and running, and we’re already collecting valuable data.

Last week threw us a curveball with some unexpected weather, but the crew adapted quickly, shifting work schedules to keep us on track. Water quality readings remain within our target range, so no red flags there.

Action Items:
- Wrap up the January 2025 environmental monitoring report
- Set up a coordination meeting with the local fishing community to plan for Phase 2
- Finalize the equipment mobilization plan for work on the southern section

Next Steps:
- Kick off sand placement at Station 15+00 (aiming for Feb 15)
- Install the last wave monitoring stations in the southern area
- Complete a pre-construction survey of dune vegetation where Phase 2 will take place
